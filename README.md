### NOVA Proxy scripts

This repository doesn't serve any NOVA scripts. It has a `uv.config.js` to show how NOVA is intended to work with this demo. NOVA Proxy automatically merges our `uv.config.js` with the remaining UV scripts (`uv.sw.js`, `uv.client.js`, etc). **Some work has to be done in order to make this repository standalone.**
